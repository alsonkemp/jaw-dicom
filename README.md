# DICOM Visualization With Python

This was code which was fairly quickly and dirtily
written to build a 3D point cloud out of DICOM files
I received from a 3D CT scan.  The files were stored
to be used by iCATVision.

Two files:
  * visualize.py - a simple 2D visualization of a slice.
    You can choose the slice and can set thresholds for
    the quantization from 16-bit down to 1-bit.

  * process.py - outputs the point cloud.

You'll need to install some additional Python modules,
but I've forgotten which.

Again, I wrote this on Christmas morning of 2012, so
don't judge me too harshly...
